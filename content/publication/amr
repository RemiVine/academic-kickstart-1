# Abstract.
abstract = "In this paper I explore the question of whether the rising demand for chicken and pig meat is positively correlated with the rising rates of AMR in humans in England. I begin by positing a relationship between demand for poultry and pork products and intensive livestock farming, in which an increasing demand is met by increasing intensification. Subsequently I investigate whether the increasing number of intensive pig and poultry farms have a positive correlation with the AMR rates in humans. This cross-species transmission can occur through food, direct contact between humans and animals, or shared environmental sources such as contaminated water."
