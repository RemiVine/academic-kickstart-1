A LaTeX template for IHEID-specific thesis is available here: [template](https://github.com/RemiVine/Thesis-template-IHEID-RV-2021)


The template is meant for thesis that are paper-based, with bibliographies for each paper and titles indexed uniquely over the whole thesis. Details are to be found on the Github repository.

Just as an illustration, here is the first page:

The template of the IHEID might be modified over time, and I do not keep track of changes, unless these are mentioned to me, so please feel free to reach out to me regarding these changes in order to let me incorporate them.
